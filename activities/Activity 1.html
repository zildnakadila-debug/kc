        <h3>You call me out upon the waters</h3>
        <h3>The great unknown where feet may fail</h3>
        <h3>And there I find You in the mystery</h3>
        <h3>In oceans deep my faith will stand</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>And I will call upon Your Name</h3>
        <h3>And keep my eyes above the waves</h3>
        <h3>When oceans rise</h3>
        <h3>My soul will rest in Your embrace</h3>
        <h3>For I am Yours and You are mine</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>So I will call upon Your Name</h3>
        <h3>And keep my eyes above the waves</h3>
        <h3>When oceans rise</h3>
        <h3>My soul will rest in Your embrace</h3>
        <h3>For I am Yours and You are mine, oh</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders</h3>
        <h3>Let me walk upon the waters</h3>
        <h3>Wherever You would call me</h3>
        <h3>Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander</h3>
        <h3>And my faith will be made stronger</h3>
        <h3>In the presence of my Saviour</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>I will call upon Your Name</h3>
        <h3>Keep my eyes above the waves</h3>
        <h3>My soul will rest in Your embrace</h3>
        <h3>I am Yours and You are mine</h3>
